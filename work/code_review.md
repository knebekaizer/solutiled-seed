Algorithm
---------

* Auto check first
* Throughput
* Limit delay - 1 day for revision max. Devote the time slot. 3 review per day. 5 would be ineffective! Sort out: delegate or skip.
* Limit revisions: 2 is OK, 3 is hard limit
* Reject immediately when unclear. Talk to author
* No priorities. No assignee. Do it all. In parallel
* 3 categories of defects

Three iterations at max 

* 1st revision: assessment, 1st pass, 2nd pass
* 2nd revision: no more assessment! Found defects fixed or postponed
* 3d revision. Talk to author. No more time spent. Accept or reject quickly.
