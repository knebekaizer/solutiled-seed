</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Java Engine Acceleration project: Acceleration framework for embedded Java VM including high/mid-level 
optimizer, ahead-of-time and just-in-time compilers, optimized 
interpreter, class caching and other acceleration-related components. Architect and project technical leader. 
</li><li>Cosmos VM project: Innovative multitasking embedded Java VM (Motorola independent implementation). 
	Architect, project technical lead, developer. 
	Design goal was: managed runtime tightly integrated with OS for the best utilization of resources and services, which makes Java application the first class OS entity, e.g. available for RTOS scheduling.  Implementation was built around the concept of "perfect transparent JNI": full bi-directional Java/C++ interop including direct method calls, object inheritance, integrated type system, exceptions, memory management, threading etc.  <br>
	Two US patents granted in this area.
